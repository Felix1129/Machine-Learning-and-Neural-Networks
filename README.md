## Neural network
The concept of neural network originates from the human central nervous system. 
Neurons form a network in the human body to transmit information and cause the human body to respond. 
Just like the human nervous system, a neural network connects each neuron to each node in the form of nodes and generates the results to be calculated, thus forming a multi-layer, multi-node neural network.
